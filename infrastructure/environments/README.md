# `/infrastructure/environments/`

Environments represent the concrete realization of infrastructure.  
They are the point where abstract definitions (e.g. modules, clusters) are bound to specific contextsâ€”such as regions, credentials, and usage profiles.

Each environment specifies:

- **What** is deployed (referencing modules and configurations)
- **Where** it is deployed (cloud regions, accounts, etc.)
- **Why** it is deployed (e.g. dev, staging, prod)

Environments are the final composition layer in the infrastructure model.
