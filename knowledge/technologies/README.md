# `/knowledge/technologies`

This directory provides a curated list of technologies—large and small—in use across this project. It includes frontend and backend components (internal and external), toolchains, platform facilities, deployables, and other binaries or services.

Each file is a concise summary of a specific technology, its purpose within our system, and links to further documentation or rationale (internal or external).

Not all technologies are relevant to all contributors, but this directory serves as a shared map of the ecosystem—one that supports understanding, onboarding, and long-term maintainability.

> [!NOTE]
> If something is missing, outdated, or unclear, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with improvements. We encourage evolving this knowledge base over time.

### Suggested entry format
Each file should include:
- **Frontmatter tags**
- **What it is**  
- **Why we use it**  
- **Where it fits in the system**  
- **Links** to internal decisions, documentation, or external sources
